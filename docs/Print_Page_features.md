Now, when the button is clicked, I would like it to send a request to a 
RISK server running on this machine.  I have another block of code for 
the server. It calls an API (written in GO with Java interfaces) that 
knows how to talk to the printer itself.  There is a template that tells 
the printer where the photo and name are to be printed.  The RISK message 
exchange would be something like "get printer status", "queue print", 
"query status", repeat query status until it says the print is complete...or 
the Cancel button is clicked.  The message names are probably not correct.  
There is probably some exchange to configure the printer before the print 
can be queued.



After the print is complete, we need to read the RFID tag on the printed 
id card and associate it with this cardholder.  So you would prompt the user 
to scan the new card, by popping up an entry field called RFID ID.  The 
card scanner will be connected to the machine that is running the browser, 
not the server.  The card scanner, by default, looks like a keyboard.  
When scanned, it "types" the 8 digit code preprogrammed in the card.  This 
needs to be "typed" into the RFID id field so the curser must be positioned 
there.  As soon as the 8th digit is entered, Javascript should save the form 
back to the database with the state set to active and the issue date set 
to today's date.   Then reload the cardholder's list screen, with the 
cursor positioned to the cardholders entry.

Reponce from Gemini

This is a significant feature, so let's break it down into manageable phases. 
You are exactly right that the first step is to understand the communication 
with the RISK server.

Here is the high-level plan for how we can build this entire feature, followed 
by the request for the code you mentioned.

The Implementation Plan
Phase 1: RISK Server Communication (The Backend-to-Backend Link)
This is our starting point. We need to define how the WordPress PHP backend 
will talk to your RISK server's API.

The WordPress backend will act as a client to your RISK server.
We will create a new AJAX action in WordPress. When the browser calls this 
action, the PHP function will use WordPress's wp_remote_post() or wp_remote_get() 
functions to send the necessary commands (e.g., get printer status, queue print) 
to the RISK server's local endpoint (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:port/api/...).
To do any of this, we first need to know the exact API contract: the endpoints, 
the expected request data (JSON?), and the format of the responses.
Phase 2: The Print Page User Interface (The Browser UI)
Once we know how to talk to the RISK server, we will modify the "Print Photo ID" 
page to drive the process.

We'll change the existing "Print ID Card" button. It will no longer 
call window.print(). Instead, its click will trigger a JavaScript function.
This function will initiate the AJAX call to the WordPress backend (from Phase 1) 
to start the print process.
The UI will be updated dynamically to show the status: "Contacting printer...", 
"Printing in progress...", "Print complete!". This will involve JavaScript polling 
our WordPress backend for the status.
When the "Print complete!" status is received, the UI will change again to hide 
the print status and display the "RFID ID" input field, automatically focusing 
the cursor there.
Phase 3: RFID Capture and Final Save (The Closing Loop)
This is the final step in the workflow.

JavaScript will monitor the RFID input field. When the input length reaches 8 
characters, it will automatically trigger a final AJAX call to WordPress.
We'll create a second AJAX action in WordPress to handle this "save" operation.
This PHP function will receive the cardholder_id and the new rfid_id. It will 
perform validation (is the RFID a duplicate?) and then update the database record, 
setting the status to active and recording the card_issue_date.
Upon a successful response from this save action, the JavaScript will redirect 
the user back to the main cardholder list page.
Our First Step: Understanding the API
As you correctly stated, we must start with Phase 1. The entire workflow depends 
on knowing how to communicate with your RISK server.

Please upload the relevant Java code that defines or interacts with the API. 
I will be looking for things like:

The names of the API calls (e.g., "get printer status", "queue print").
The HTTP method for each call (GET, POST, etc.).
The structure of the data sent to the server (e.g., a JSON object with 
cardholder_name, photo_base64, etc.).
The structure of the data returned by the server.
Once I can see that, we can build the first piece of the puzzle: the PHP 
function in WordPress that communicates with it.
